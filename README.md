# Statistical-learning

## Supervised
The second leading cause of death worldwide is stroke according to the world health 
organization. It is a medical condition induced by an insufficient blood supply to the 
brain that can have a more or less serious impact depending on how quickly it is treated. 
Whenever it does not lead to death, often leaves the survivor with some severe disabilities 
which might concern both the physical and psychological spheres. It is a very widespread 
pathology indeed among people over the age of 25 about 25% will experience stroke soon 
or later. Not only the studies about the biological and medical aspects of the disease 
furnish the necessary knowledge to fight it. Also the statistical analysis of inherent data 
can provide some answers useful for preventing it. In this paper a logistic regression has 
been applied to determine a model able to classify those patients who are more likely to 
have a brain attack, grounding the analysis on the value of several factors of risk.
Subsequently a penalized logistic regression is run to perform subset selection and to 
determine the most relevant predictors.

## Unsupervised
Unsupervised statistical learning methods take as input unlabelled observations which are
records about different variables without a response. Therefore the modelling is focused 
on the detection of correlations among the features rather than prediction or inference on 
a specific target or outcome. These techniques are useful to better visualize the data, to 
reduce the dimensionality of the attributes and to discover similarities among groups of 
observations. In this specific analysis they find application in the study of a dataset 
regarding different socioeconomic characteristics for several countries. First a principal
component analysis is implemented to summarize the variables information into a lower 
number of components. Then a K-means clustering algorithm is applied to highlight 
similarities among countries, grouping those most similar together. Concretely such 
analysis could be supportive for some international organization, e.g. the International 
Monetary Fund or the World Bank, in deciding to which countries addressing most of 
their short and long term economic aid.
